(This project has been moved to  https://github.com/jsbueno/pyleptonica (this time without the extra "h")
Sorry - but for the repository export, no updates at this moment. Just bug me if you need this project, and I might come back to it.



This project aims to be a Python transparent wrapper for the Leptonica Library. (http://www.leptonica.com)

It uses ctypes, and, currently, some scripts to automatically wrap most leptonica functions into Python

It is currently in a very early stage and most functions require manually mangling with pointers and structures before being called.
